# Emacs

> Notes aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.

## Motivation
I started with modal text editting using Vim. I still use vim, but I needed an organization system to read, write and organize thoughts. Enter Doom Emacs.

Emacs has a different philosophy from Vim, and it's that it's intended to be heavily personalized for the user. However, being a heavily customized piece of software, revisiting configuration settings made many months ago can be difficult even as the original creator. This is such an often occurance on planet Emacs that it has a term for it: **Emac bankruptcy**. This repository exists as source control and documentation to manage the configuration file from becoming a looming burden.
